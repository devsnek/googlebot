If you really want to run this thing, you will need to create two files in the root of the project.

1. `config.json`
2. `keys.txt`

`config.json` contains all the api keys, settings, and etc for running the bot. You will have to read through the project to see what goes in it; I won't be providing an example.

`keys.txt` contains google search api keys, one per line, for the `search` and `image` commands.
